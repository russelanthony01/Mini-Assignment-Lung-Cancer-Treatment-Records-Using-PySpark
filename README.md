# 🫁 Mini-Assignment: Lung Cancer Treatment Records Using PySpark

### 📌 Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of a **synthetic Lung Cancer Patient Health & Treatment dataset**.

The analysis focuses on identifying **clinical and lifestyle factors** influencing cancer stage severity, treatment duration, and survival outcomes.

The notebook demonstrates **data engineering + analytics** using:

- **Python** for programming
- **PySpark** for scalable data processing  
- **Pandas** for tabular transformations  
- **Matplotlib & Plotly** for data visualization  

> ⚠️ *Dataset is synthetic and used only for academic/learning purposes.*
